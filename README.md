# DesktopAssistant
Tony Stark's idea of Jarvis is now Vision and Fryday is Natasha
This is a basic Version of an AI desktop assisstant that helps with doing tasks i perform frequently on my system(using VS Code, playing Music, Sending Emails....).
The limit of the assisstant is your own coding limit(I didn't code too much though)
PS:Natasha and Vision can talk to each other :)
